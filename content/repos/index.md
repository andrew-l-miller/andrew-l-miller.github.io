# My Repositories

Here are some of my key projects:

- **[cw_constrain](https://github.com/andrew-l-miller/cw_constrain)**  
  A Python package for constraining continuous gravitational waves using dark matter models. Provides easy-to-use tools for analyzing gravitational wave data.

- **[pyhough](https://github.com/andrew-l-miller/pyhough)**  
  A Python implementation of the Hough transform method to detect continuous gravitational waves in noisy data.
