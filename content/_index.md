      Experienced scientist and data analyst with expertise in machine learning, signal processing, statistics, audio-frequency time domain data, and Python, with a strong background in physics, mathematics, and computing. Excellent communicator, independent and collaborative researcher; adept at bridging the gap between groups.

      Since 2015, I have been a member of the Nobel Prize-winning LIGO Scientific Collaboration, a big-data astrophysics experiment, holding many leadership roles. 

      Currently, I am developing statistical methods to detect dark matter and gravitational waves from black holes and neutron stars.
