  addendum = { \linebreak \linebreak I developed a method to detect primordial black hole inspirals with masses less than $10^{-3}M_\odot$ using the Hough Transform. I showed that advanced and future gravitational-wave detectors will be able to place physical constraints on the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose. \linebreak},
