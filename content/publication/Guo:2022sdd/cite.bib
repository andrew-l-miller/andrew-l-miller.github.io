  addendum = { \linebreak \linebreak I calculated the expected distance reach as a function of mass ratio to gravitational waves emitted by hypothetical binary systems composed of one ordinary object and one exotic compact object with a much smaller mass than its companion orbiting around the heavier object. I also helped to conceputalize this work and contributed to developing the method, based on the Hough Transform, to search for these signals.  \linebreak},
