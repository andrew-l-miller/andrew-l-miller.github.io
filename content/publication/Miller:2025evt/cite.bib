  addendum = { \linebreak\linebreak I determined the extent to which continuous gravitational waves from highly deformed compact objects would be detectable by DECIGO, a future space-based gravitational-wave detector. I also studied the feasibility of doing all-sky search searches in DECIGO data, showing that they are computationally inexpensive. We also studied the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from these sources. \linebreak},
