## Overview

1. Inspiraling compact objects will emit gravitational waves as they inspiral towards one another. 
2. If their masses or orbital frequencies are low enough, they will spend hours to years inspiraling. The rate of change of the orbital frequency with time is difficult to track with continuous-wave methods, and computationally infeasible to search for with matched filtering.
3. In this tutorial, we show that a method that finds power-law tracks in the time/frequency plane can search for these objects.
4. You can access the tutorial on [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1geIuz3YJPBDtjtuoBd7J7Jasw4rm2Yre?usp=sharing).
