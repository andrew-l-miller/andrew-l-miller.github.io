## Overview

1. Deformed, isolated neutron stars could spin down due to the loss of energy via gravitational waves. The timescale of energy loss greatly exceeds that of the observation time of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, and the gravitational-wave frequency is almost constant; hence, these signals are called continuous gravitational waves. The gravitational-wave signal is also Doppler modulated, due to the relative motion of the earth with respect to the source. 
2. In this tutorial, we show how a simulated continuous gravitational-wave signal from a particular sky location is recovered with a pattern recognition technique called the Hough Transform.
3. You can access the tutorial on [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NpmDG3ZUyyq9PiiLsRyjginqRNbQmtQ3?usp=sharing).
