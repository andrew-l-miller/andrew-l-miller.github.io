Over ten years ago, Fermi observed an excess of GeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center whose origin is still under debate. One explanation for this excess involves annihilating dark matter; another requires an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars concentrated at the Galactic Center. We have shown in our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10239) that gravitational waves could be used as a way of constraining the origins of this excess.
